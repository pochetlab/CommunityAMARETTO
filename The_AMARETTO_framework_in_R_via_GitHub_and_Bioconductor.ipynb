        "Computational inference of regulatory networks underlying complex human diseases is one of the fundamental goals of systems biology and has shown great promise for deciphering the regulatory cell circuits driving complex disease biology, especially in cancer. The availability of increasing volumes of multimodal data ranging from multi-omics to imaging and clinical data across multiscale systems promises to improve our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying complex human diseases. The main challenges are to integrate the multiple levels of multimodal data within biological systems and to translate them across multiscale biological systems to decipher the underpinnings of human diseases.\n",

        "Here we introduce the <B>&#42;AMARETTO framework</B> as a toolbox for learning how regulatory networks - cell circuits and their drivers - are shared or distinct within and across biological systems with a broad range of applications, from disease subtyping to driver and drug discovery in studies of human disease such as cancer. The &#42;AMARETTO toolbox currently consists of two algorithmic tools:\n",

        "(<B>2</B>) The <B>Community-AMARETTO algorithm</B> enables multiscale inference to learn how these regulatory networks are shared or distinct across biological systems (e.g., across diseases, across cohorts, across model systems and patient studies, and across <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> systems). \n",

        "\n",
        "The &#42;AMARETTO framework currently consists of two algorithmic software tools. First, <B>AMARETTO</B> infers regulatory networks within each biological system via multi-omics data fusion. Specifically, AMARETTO identifies potential cancer drivers by identifying genes whose genetic and epigenetic cancer aberrations have a direct functional impact on their own transcriptomic or proteomic expression. These (epi)genetic drivers can be augmented, intersected or replaced with predefined candidate drivers with known regulatory function (e.g., transcription factors from TFutils). AMARETTO then connects these drivers in a regulatory program with modules of co-expressed target genes that they putatively control, defined as regulatory modules or cell circuits, using a regularized regression algorithm (i.e., Elastic Net regression). Next, <B>Community-AMARETTO</B> learns communities or subnetworks by connecting regulatory networks inferred from different systems using an edge betweenness community detection algorithm (i.e., Girvan Newman) to identify cell circuits and drivers that are shared and distinct across biological systems and diseases.\n",
        "\n",
        "The &#42;AMARETTO framework additionally offers tools for <B>downstream analytic functionalities</B> on both module and community levels, including functional annotation of modules and communities (e.g., using known functional categories from MSigDB), stratifying modules and communities for increasingly specific phenotypes (e.g., patient characteristics such as survival, molecular subclasses, known (epi)genetic cancer aberrations, or features derived from histopathology and  radiographic imaging, as well as in-depth studies of etiologies of cancer via spatiotemporal - time course and/or single-cell - studies in model systems), validation of predicted drivers (e.g., using genetic perturbation studies in model systems – knockdown or overexpression experiments of driver genes), discovering drugs targeting drivers and their predicted target genes (e.g., using chemical perturbation studies in model systems), and systematic assessment and benchmarking of the networks for generalized prediction performance of the (sub)networks."
